step1: start
step2:select start and end points of the curve 
step3:calculate the distance between the start and end points  
step4: identify the maximum distance (farthest point)
step5:If maximum distance is within the tolerance , simplify the curve by replacing all ponits with a straight line
step6:if it exceeds the tolerance repeat the process until all segments are within the tolerance
step7:end
